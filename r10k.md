# r10k

## Why r10k

r10k is a tool that help us manage the Puppet manifests and modules with git. With r10k, we can set up repositories for each module. r10k help us pull them down and put them into right place automatically. What modules to be pull down is decided by the dependency stored in file `Puppetfile` of each module. 

That sounds like `puppet module install` can also do the same thing. But the most attractive part is that, those dependencies can be a few git repository, while the `puppet module install` can only download dependency from puppet forge. So the result is that, after you commit some changes to some modules, to deploy those changes, you don't have to pull them down respectively. If you have set up the main repository location, a sigle command `r10k deploy environment -p` will do all the things!

 Another feature of r10k is that r10k will set up environments for each branch. So it is possible to set up a "test" environment without affecting the production one. 

## Install and confugure 

To install
````
gem install r10k
````

Create file `/etc/puppetlabs/r10k/r10k.yaml` 
````yaml
# The location to use for storing cached Git repos
:cachedir: '/opt/puppetlabs/r10k/cache'

# A list of git repositories to create
:sources:
  # This will clone the git repository and instantiate an environment per
  # branch in /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments
  :cloud:
    remote: 'git@github.com:csie-cloud/cloud.git'
    basedir: '/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments'
````

## Repository where r10k pull from

First, ensure that deploy keys are set. That is, add public key of deploy node to deploy key on github or bitbucket.

And there are some files required to make every thing work smoothly:
* environment.conf
* Puppetfile

To make each environment use different module source, modules must be install in the directory of each environment. Also, the `modulepath` also have to be specified in `environment.conf` like (multiple path can be divided using `:`)
````
modulepath = modules
```` 

The `Puppetfile` specifies the dependency, there are [some examples on r10k's repository](https://github.com/puppetlabs/r10k/blob/master/doc/puppetfile.mkd#examples). In the file, the location where modules should be install can also be specified. The default value of `moduledir` is `./modules` relative to `Puppetfile`, namely root of the repository. The path should be consistent with `modulepath` defined in environment. Therefore, use the default value (not specify explicitly) is fine.
